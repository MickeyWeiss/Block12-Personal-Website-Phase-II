        <p><b>World traveler!</b> In my travels I have enjoyed galavanting around Europe, South America and the Middle East. Traveling has always been one of my greatest passions. In my previoius life, working to facilitate the importation of cut flowers from South America to the United States, I was privilaged enough to make many sojourns to Colombia and Ecuador. I have also toured around Europe, Israel, the Caribbean and been to over 40 of the United States.</p><br>
